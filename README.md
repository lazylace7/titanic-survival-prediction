# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies supervised machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck, based on features like age, gender, ticket class and family connections. It uses the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle and walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation.


## Problem Statement

Build a predictive model that classifies passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on their characteristics and ticket information.


## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- **File Used**: `train.csv`
- **Target Variable**: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)


## Key Steps Performed

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature engineering (title extraction, family size)
- Model building using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix and cross-validation


## Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
